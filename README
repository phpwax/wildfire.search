Provides SearchController.

Has a config for Search params default is:

public $search_fields = array('text'=>array('cols'=>array('title', 'content'), 'fuzzy'=>true));

'text' is the key on the $_REQUEST search array - $_REQUEST['search']['text']
'cols' are the columns on the model (model is based on the $cms_content_class)
'fuzzy' does a like, otherwise an exact match

all you need to do is make a view in app/view/search/index that uses $results
